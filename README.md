## Comprehensive Financial and Operational Analysis of Canadian SMEs

The landscape of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Canada is dynamic, characterized by diverse financial strategies and operational challenges. 

This project delves into the intricacies of SME financing behaviors, operational dynamics, and strategic decision-making processes using comprehensive data from the 2020 Survey on Financing and Growth of SMEs conducted by Statistics Canada, supplemented by insights from a marketing company's SME database.

The primary objectives of this study are to analyze the financing preferences of Canadian SMEs, evaluate the success rates of financing applications across different sectors, and develop predictive models for approval rates across various financing types. Additionally, the study explores the influence of innovation, digital transformation, and external consulting on SME performance and growth.
